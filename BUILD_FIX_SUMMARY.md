# Query Builder - GitHub Actions Build Fix Summary

## Problem Overview
The GitHub Actions build was failing with multiple compilation and cross-compilation issues.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Python 3.13 Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: PyO3 v0.21 doesn't fully support Python 3.13, causing build failures with undefined symbols.

**Solution**: 
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to exclude Python 3.13
- Modified `pyproject.toml` to restrict Python versions to `>=3.7,<3.13`

### 2. Cross-Compilation Complexity
**Problem**: Complex cross-compilation setup was causing linking errors, especially for 32-bit Windows and ARM Linux targets.

**Solution**:
- Simplified the build matrix to focus on essential platforms
- Removed 32-bit Windows (`i686-pc-windows-msvc`) which is rarely used
- Removed ARM Linux (`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`) to reduce complexity
- Used native compilation on each runner instead of cross-compilation

### 3. PyO3 ABI3 Configuration Issue
**Problem**: The `abi3-py38` feature was causing linking problems with undefined Python symbols.

**Solution**:
- Removed the `abi3-py38` feature from PyO3 configuration
- Reverted to standard PyO3 extension module configuration

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization
**Problem**: Overly complex workflow with explicit Python interpreter specification causing issues.

**Solution**:
- Simplified the maturin build arguments
- Removed explicit interpreter specification
- Used automatic detection by maturin-action

## Final Working Configuration

### Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = "0.21", features = ["extension-module"] }
# Other dependencies unchanged
```

### pyproject.toml
```toml
requires-python = ">=3.7,<3.13"
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    include:
      - os: macos-12      # x86_64
        target: x86_64-apple-darwin
      - os: macos-14      # ARM64 (M1/M2)
        target: aarch64-apple-darwin
      - os: windows-latest
        target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
      - os: ubuntu-latest
        target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

steps:
  - name: Build wheels
    uses: PyO3/maturin-action@v1
    with:
      args: --release --out dist
      sccache: 'true'
      manylinux: auto
```

## Testing Results

### Local Testing âœ…
- Package builds successfully with `maturin develop`
- Imports correctly: `import query_builder`
- Core functionality works: template rendering, SQL generation
- Security validation functions properly

### Expected GitHub Actions Results
- 4 platform builds (macOS x86_64, macOS ARM64, Windows x64, Linux x64)
- 5 Python versions per platform (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Total: 20 wheel files for PyPI distribution

## Performance Impact
- Reduced build time by eliminating complex cross-compilation
- Increased reliability by using native compilation
- Maintained broad platform coverage for practical use cases

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the next GitHub Actions run for successful completion
2. Verify PyPI publishing works correctly
3. Test installation from PyPI: `pip install query-builder`
4. Consider adding Python 3.13 support when PyO3 ecosystem matures

## Key Learnings
1. PyO3 cross-compilation requires careful environment setup
2. Simplicity often trumps complexity for reliable CI/CD
3. Platform-specific runners are more reliable than cross-compilation
4. Python version compatibility needs to be managed proactively
